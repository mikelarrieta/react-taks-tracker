## Usage
Clone the project using `git clone` command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikelarrieta/react-taks-tracker.git
```

Then, in the root folder of the project, install the dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

To run the **application** in development (local):
```bash
npm start
```

To run the **fake REST API** in development (local):
```bash
npm run server
```

For the application to work correctly, both **React application** and **fake REST API** need to be running in localhost.
